         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a"><b>Axis My India</b> ,a leader in consumer data analytics, presents compelling findings from the latest India Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) that underscore the dynamic shifts in media consumption patterns across Indian households. The data reveals a nuanced change in media engagement, with a slight increase in families consuming various media forms like TV, Internet, and Radio. In the rapidly evolving digital era, marked by the widespread use of smartphones and affordable internet, there is a noticeable shift towards streaming platforms. 25% of respondents are moving away from traditional cable or satellite subscriptions, embracing the flexibility of digital streaming services.

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The sentiment analysis delves into five relevant sub-indices – Overall household spending, spending on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits, entertainment & tourism trends.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The survey was carried out via Computer-Aided Telephonic Interviews with a sample size of 10019 people across 36 states and UTs. 70% belonged to rural India, while 30% belonged to urban counterparts. In terms of regional spread, 25% belong to the Northern parts while 27% belong to the Eastern parts of India. Moreover, 28% and 20% belonged to Western and Southern parts of India respectively. 61% of the respondents were male, while 39% were female.

In H2 overall consumer spending had reached a status quo bias where the keenness to increase consumption had been limited, mainly due to inflation & rise in interest rates. However, a majority mentioning that the current government has been able to handle India's economic situation better than other countries reflects India’s overall performance in 2022. Moving forward, the intent to invest & save more in 2023 reflects the current environment of resilience & cautious growth.”</p>

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Axis My India, a leading consumer data intelligence company, released its latest findings of the India Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI), a monthly analysis of consumer perception on a wide range of issues. The December report reveals that sentiments have dipped across 3 out of 5 sub-indices. While spends across health products has improved reflecting an increased by 3% from last month, sentiments however remain same as last month for essential consumption. The survey further highlights that 34% of consumers notice in store promotional offers and 50% of them believe it influences their purchase decision.</p>

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The sentiment analysis delves into five relevant sub-indices – Overall household spending, spending on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits, entertainment & tourism trends</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The survey was carried out via Computer-Aided Telephonic Interviews with a sample size of 10454 people across 33 states and UTs. 69% belonged to rural India, while 31% belonged to urban counterparts. In terms of regional spread, 24% belong to the Northern parts while 27% belong to the Eastern parts of India. Moreover, 29% and 20% belonged to Western and Southern parts of India respectively. 61% of the respondents were male, while 39% were female. In terms of the two majority sample groups, 32% reflect the age group 36YO to 50YO and 29% reflect the age group of 26YO to 35YO.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Commenting on the CSI report, Pradeep Gupta, Chairman & MD, Axis My India, said “Consumers have experienced a full circle, starting with restricted spending due to COVID19, moving on to revenge shopping after the restrictions were relaxed to festive sentiments, and finally to stagnation due to inflation. Whether it is spends on essential/discretionary products or travel and tourism inflation continues to impact these indices of consumer sentiment. This may be one of the factors influencing customers to choose domestic travel over foreign ones. The spending capacity which is elevated basis ones savings is at the moment impact by increased interest rates. Diverting spends on healthcare is another critical reason. The post pandemic behaviour of investment in health and healthy choices continues to remain top priority of several households. Finally, even though spending on essential and non-essential appears to reflect lowered sentiments, marketers should note that exploring and experiencing enticing offers from physical stores continues to influence consumer purchase decisions. Therefore, marketers should capitalise on this to improve and increase in-store purchases.”</p>

The November report reveals that sentiments have improved across all 5 sub-indices. Spends across discretionary products increased for 11% of the families, demarcating the highest in the last five months. The survey further highlights that local kirana stores continue to remain the top choice for everyday grocery shopping, which is a view of 86%.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The November net CSI score, calculated by percentage increase minus percentage decrease in sentiment, is at +09, from +08 last month reflecting an increase by 01 point</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The sentiment analysis delves into five relevant sub-indices – Overall household spending, spending on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits & mobility trends.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The survey was carried out via Computer-Aided Telephonic Interviews with a sample size of 10207 people across 32 states and UTs. 70% belonged to rural India, while 30% belonged to urban counterparts. In terms of regional spread, 26% belong to the Northern parts while 24% belong to the Eastern parts of India. Moreover 30% and 20% belonged to Western and Southern parts of India respectively. 56% of the respondents were male, while 44% were female. In terms of the two majority sample groups, 28% each reflect the age group of 26YO to 35YO and 36YO to 50YO.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Commenting on the CSI report, Pradeep Gupta, Chairman & MD, Axis My India, said India's steady economic growth and hints of sinking prices have resulted in recovery in consumer confidence. The month-long celebrations have served to amplify this spirit. Convenience and concessions also continue to influence consumer attitudes toward purchases and the demand for goods and services. Online apps are gaining ground in consumers' minds even as local kiranas continue to meet the demand for everyday grocery shopping. Similarly, while rebates and discounts are triggering budgeted purchases, the sale of big-ticket items are still restricted. Therefore, while overall spends provide a positive outlook, one can witness novel behaviours of splurge and scrimp pertaining to categories and mode of purchase.</p>

The July report highlights that 25% of Indians watched IPL this year, which means a significant 75% didn’t watch IPL. The survey further discovered that 65% have watched IPL through television and 29% through digital platforms. These numbers gain significant importance given the unprecedented valuation at which the IPL media rights were recently sold.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The July net CSI score, calculated by percentage increase minus percentage decrease in sentiment, is at +9, from +10 last month reflecting a very minor decrease by 1 point.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The sentiment analysis delves into five relevant sub-indices – Overall household spending, spending on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits & mobility trends.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">This month, Axis My India’s Sentiment survey delved deeper to gauge consumer views on petrol and diesel prices, interest on Indian Premier League and eagerness for movie hall experiences. The survey also strived to understand consumer’s thoughts on early retirement and factors that influences brand purchases.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a"><b>The survey was carried out via Computer-Aided Telephonic Interviews with a sample size of 10409 people across 35 states & UT’s. 70% belonged to rural India, while 30% belonged to urban counterparts. In terms of regional spread, 24% of each belonged to Northern and Eastern parts while 29% and 23% belonged to Western and Southern parts of India respectively.  In addition, 63% of the respondents were male, while 37% were female. In terms of the two majority sample groups, 28% reflect the age group of 36YO to 50YO, while 21% reflect the age group of 26YO to 35YO.</b></p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Commenting on the CSI report, Pradeep Gupta, CMD, Axis My India, said,<i>“Overtime, consumer spending has reached a status quo bias where the keenness to increase consumption has been limited. This is mainly due to inflation and the after effects of pandemic which has made it difficult for consumers to see their nominal incomes recover to pre-pandemic levels. While in response to this the government has reduced the petrol and diesel prices, a major chunk of consumers are still looking for further ease. Similarly in media, one can witness respondents suffering from consumption fatigue which could be related to innumerable choice of content, ease in mobility and the availability of experiencing ‘cinema’ etc. The craze around IPL persists across platforms but whether this excitement justifies its high media rights, time will tell. Digital viewership is on a high trajectory. In terms of consumption behaviour, a significant proportion of consumers are increasingly taking their purchase decision basis reputation of the brand with price as the 2nd key factor, which shows the growing maturity of Indian consumers.”</i></p>

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Axis My India, a leading consumer data intelligence company, released its latest findings of the <b>India Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI)</b>,a monthly analysis of consumer perception on a wide range of issues. The June finding reports consumer views on the impact of increased interest rates on household spending. The survey also gauged respondent’s views on the most resonated leaders in the corporate and in the political ecosystem amongst youth. Indian industrialist, philanthropist, and former chairman of Tata Sons - Ratan Tata with 28% and Prime Minister Narendra Modi with 48% secured the majority votes for the same.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The June net CSI score, calculated by percentage increase minus percentage decrease in sentiment, was down to +10, from +12 last month.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The sentiment analysis delves into five relevant sub-indices – Overall household spending, spending on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits & mobility trends.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">This month, Axis My India’s Sentiment survey delved deeper to understand media consumption trends across varied platforms. The report also gauged consumer views on most resonated corporate and political youth leaders. Finally the findings reflected consumer’s outlook on the direct impact of the increased interest rates on household spending.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a"><b>The survey was carried out via Computer-Aided Telephonic Interviews with a sample size of 10613 people across 28 states and 8 UTs. 73% belonged to Rural India, while 27% belonged to urban counterparts. In addition, 65% of the respondents were male, while 35% were female. In terms of regional spread, 22% belonged to Northern parts, 24% belonged to Eastern parts while 30% and 24% belonged to Western and Southern parts of India. In terms of the two majority sample groups, 35% reflect the age group of 36YO to 50YO, while 29% reflect the age group of 26YO to 35YO. In addition, 65% represent the male population while 35% represent the female population.</b></p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Commenting on the CSI report, Pradeep Gupta, CMD, Axis My India, said,<i>“The rise in inflation have impacted spending across essential, discretionary and luxury commodities. The high prices have taken away the purchasing power of the consumers wherein they are forced to restrict their expenses. This downward sentiment is not alone reflected in the expenditure side, media consumption has also dipped by 3% from last month. However, one can witness a slow and steady shift from television to digital media consumption with a higher time spent on digital. Given the interactive nature of the digital media, almost 42% have also interacted with formats like reels opening up lots of opportunities for brands and organisations to reach their younger audience. These younger spirits are however extremely aware of brands and leaders who are contributing towards the country’s social, political and economic developments. This is reflected in their choice of aspirational leaders like Narendra Modi, who is incidentally also celebrating 20 years of efficient & effective governance, and Ratan Tata who with their years of leadership, business philosophy and philanthropy have won the hearts of millions."</i></p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px; color:#4a4a4a;text-align:justify;color:#92278f;font-size:20px"><b>On topics of current national interest:</b></p>
         <ul style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px; color:#4a4a4a;text-align:justify;list-style-position: inside">
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif" />  More and more Indian organisations are expanding their footprint towards corporate social responsibility and global leadership under exceptional leaders. To understand consumer’s perception on the same, Axis My India surveyed the youth about their preferred corporate leaders. Veteran Indian industrialist, philanthropist, and former chairman of Tata Sons, Ratan Tata was voted by the majority at 28%. This was despite Mr. Tata not being actively involved with the day-to-day business aspects and shows the importance of a strong trustworthy leader. He was followed by Mukesh Ambani, Chairman & MD, Reliance Industries at 20%. Other leaders that were noted include Anand Mahindra, Gautam Adani, Narayan Murthy and Chandrashekhar.</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif" />  The CSI – Survey furthermore captured Indian Youth’s consideration in terms of the most resonating political leader. Among a vetted list of personalities, it was discovered that Prime Minister, Narendra Modi enjoyed the vast majority vote representing the choice of 48% of people, distantly followed by Arvind Kejriwal at 8% and Rahul Gandhi at 6% who was third in the list.</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif" />  Axis My India further evaluated consumers’ views on the increased rates (loans) announced by the government. The survey discovered that 75% believe that the increase in rate will directly impact household spends. However, 19% believe otherwise.</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif" />  The survey further dug deeper to understand media consumption trends among consumers. As per the survey a majority of 20% said that on an average day, they spend 1hr-2hrs watching TV. In addition, 18% spend 30mins-1hr watching TV. In terms of Digital medium, 19% said that on an average day, they spend 1hr-2hrs on the internet. A second group of 16% said that they prefer investing 2hrs-4hrs on the internet. The average time spent on digital is 66 minutes and digital is 105 minutes. The findings reflect a close competition between the two mediums and a slow but steady shift towards digital media consumption.</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif" />  The survey further explored respondents interaction with video-focused social networking formats like Instagram Reels, YouTube Videos, Facebook and Sharechat etc. Around 42% respondents accepted seeing or making content on video-focused social networking formats. Moreover, a majority of 34% revealed that YouTube was their most visited platform followed by Facebook (28%), Instagram Reels (25%), Sharechat (6%), Moj (3%) and MX Taka Tak (1%).</li>

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Axis My India, a leading consumer data intelligence company, released its latest findings of the <b>India Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI)</b>, a monthly analysis of consumer perception on a wide range of issues. The May report highlighted that news related to Elections, political parties, the Russia-Ukraine war; sports; entertainment and Covid related updates were the top five preferences of consumers. The survey also revealed findings within the advertising ecosystem. It discovered that majority of the respondents believe that advertisement claims on television and in the newspaper are farfetched. It also stated that ads shown by Dream11 and Tata Neu have captured the interest of consumers in this season’s IPL. At an overall level 22% of the respondents mentioned that they have watched IPL this year.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The May net CSI score, calculated by percentage increase minus percentage decrease in sentiment, was up to +12, from +11 last month and continuing the upwards trends noticed in the last 4 months.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The sentiment analysis delves into five relevant sub-indices – Overall household spending, spending on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits & mobility trends.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">This month, Axis My India’s Sentiment survey delved deeper to comprehend consumers’ views about advertisement claims on television and newspapers, most featured brands during IPL, preferred news content and interest in the Russia-Ukraine war- related news. The survey also gauged consumers’ outlook on quick gratification schemes offered and plans on New Year investments.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a"><b>The survey was carried out via Computer-Aided Telephonic Interviews with a sample size of 10166 people across 30+ states and UTs. 69% belonged to Rural India, while 31% belonged to urban counterparts. In addition, 68% of the respondents were male, while 32% were female. In terms of regional spread, 26% each belonged to Northern and Eastern parts of India, while 31% and 17% belonged to Western and Southern parts of India. In terms of the two majority sample groups, 31% reflect the age group of 26YO to 35YO, while 30% reflect the age group of 36YO to 50YO.</b></p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Commenting on the CSI report, Pradeep Gupta, CMD, Axis My India, said,<i>“The evolved and re-energised consumer community reflects optimism towards increasing expenditure in discretionary spends showcasing their affinity to ‘what they want rather than what they need’. This provides a ray light for brand and marketers to tap towards the shifting priorities of consumers. While brands are striving to capture the instant gratification instincts of consumers there is a need to understand context and content to capture the right eyeballs.  On a holistic level, it is necessary to shake the long-drawn perception of consumers being a homogenous community as every individual has distinct aspirations, seeks different investment plans, and consume varied news. The news industry has grown in the last year or two with the Pandemic, the Russia -Ukraine war or the Sri-Lankan economy crisis but elections & political news remain the most watched content by viewers. Interestingly even with better opportunities abroad, 64% Indians would prefer to stay in India and work towards a better living, something we all should be proud of."</i></p>

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Commenting on CSI report, Pradeep Gupta, CMD, Axis My India, said,<i>“With greater relaxation from the government in terms of mobility and increased encouragement from corporates to return to physical setting, we can witness the country’s effort to go back to the ‘old normal’. Consumers are spending where necessary and exercising ‘very mild’ caution on discretionary expenditures or mobility habits. Attracting consumers’ interest is also the five state elections, as they are expected to have an overall impact on the country’s economy. In addition, positive outlook towards RBI’s proposed digital currency also reflect the nations wider acceptance towards this change. PM Narendra Modi being voted as the leader best suited to guide India’s internal & external security in the wake of the current Russia-Ukraine crisis is not a surprise. Finally, increased online ad consumption & online purchase behaviour reflect the gradual dominance of digital in a consumer’s life and the need for marketers to develop an omni-channel marketing strategy.”</i></p>

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Axis My India, a leading consumer data intelligence company, announced the launch of India Consumer Sentiment Index(CSI), a detailed trend analysis which will track real time shifts in consumer sentiment nationally.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">A monthly index, the CSI will focus on providing intelligence and insights from the length and breadth of the nation, analysing several subtleties and nuances that influence perceptions and compile them into a consolidated scoring system based index. The consumer sentiment scores will be based on a moving average of adult residents across all states and Union Territories in India.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The sentiment analysis will delve into 5relevant sub-indices –Overall household spending, spending on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits & mobility trends.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The CSI follows the methodology of a national representative random probability sample as used in the standardised CATI(Computer aided telephonic interview)methodology, covering all geographic and demographic segments across all states and Union Territories in India.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Commenting on the launch of the report, Pradeep Gupta, CMD, Axis My India, said, <i>“The India Consumer Sentiment Index is our endeavour to capture the shifts in the pulse of the demographic as we navigate a radically altered post-pandemic world. We have selected relevant categories like inflation in household spends and expenditure on healthcare to account for everyday challenges affecting a significant percentage of the population. While the second wave negatively impacted economic sentiment around employment and business prospects, the index will aspire to demonstrate the accurate picture based on the remodelling of the vaccine distribution strategy, which has shown encouraging results. By plugging into economically and culturally significant data-points, the CSI will try to gauge, interpret,and predict the impact of macro factors on the lives of the average Indiaacross demography & geographies. Our mission is to bring out the most authentic voices via the rigour of data and analytics”</i></p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">All interviews are conducted through CATI, among nationally representative sample of 10865adults. Surveys are weighted in each district by age, gender,occupation,and region.</p>

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The sentiment analysis delves into 5 relevant sub-indices – Overall household spending, spending on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits & mobility trends</p>

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Commenting on the Ocober report, Pradeep Gupta, CMD, Axis My India, said,<i>“The survey captures consumer’s apprehension yet preparedness and confidence to the advent of Omicron. While essential, non-essential and health related increased expenditures witnessed a dip, consumers at the same time have expressed their confidence of not being financially impacted by the 3rd Wave. Moreover, in our attempt to discover consumer information consumption habit, we witnessed a growing possibility of shared space competitiveness between TV and online for influencing ad based purchase decisions. However online space unlike TV is an interactive platform and thereby possess the challenges of ensuring security and safety of data shared by consumers. Overall with the nation’s sentiments resuming back to slow and steady normalcy and more opportunities opening up within the media space, advertisers and marketers are in a sweet spot and should thereby leave no space untouched.”</i></p>

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Axis My India, a leading consumer data intelligence company, announced the launch of India Consumer Sentiment Index(CSI), a detailed trend analysis which will track real time shifts in consumer sentiment nationally.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">A monthly index, the CSI will focus on providing intelligence and insights from the length and breadth of the nation, analysing several subtleties and nuances that influence perceptions and compile them into a consolidated scoring system based index. The consumer sentiment scores will be based on a moving average of adult residents across all states and Union Territories in India.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The sentiment analysis will delve into 5relevant sub-indices –Overall household spending, spending on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits & mobility trends.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The CSI follows the methodology of a national representative random probability sample as used in the standardised CATI(Computer aided telephonic interview)methodology, covering all geographic and demographic segments across all states and Union Territories in India.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Commenting on the launch of the report, Pradeep Gupta, CMD, Axis My India, said, <i>“The India Consumer Sentiment Index is our endeavour to capture the shifts in the pulse of the demographic as we navigate a radically altered post-pandemic world. We have selected relevant categories like inflation in household spends and expenditure on healthcare to account for everyday challenges affecting a significant percentage of the population. While the second wave negatively impacted economic sentiment around employment and business prospects, the index will aspire to demonstrate the accurate picture based on the remodelling of the vaccine distribution strategy, which has shown encouraging results. By plugging into economically and culturally significant data-points, the CSI will try to gauge, interpret,and predict the impact of macro factors on the lives of the average Indiaacross demography & geographies. Our mission is to bring out the most authentic voices via the rigour of data and analytics”</i></p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">All interviews are conducted through CATI, among nationally representative sample of 10865adults. Surveys are weighted in each district by age, gender,occupation,and region.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#92278f;font-size:20px"><b>Key findings:</b>
         <ul style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px; color:#4a4a4a; text-align:justify;list-style-position: inside">
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif"/>  With the second wave of Covid subsiding and normalcy slowly starting up,the household spends has increased for 54% of the families. The household spend net score which is % increased -% decreased is at +39.This spend pattern is the same across Urban & Rural markets but the increase is much more in North with 61% as comparedto the other zones.</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif"/>  Carrying the same trend, spends on essentials like personal care & household care products is up for 43% of families, while it’sdecreased for 27% families. The essential consumption net scoreis at +16.The difference is in eastern India where consumption has only increased in 31% households.Also housewives are more reluctant to spends on essentials as compared to the working population.</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif"/>  Keeping in mind long terminsecurity the spends on non-essential & discretionary items like durables, car has increased only for 15% families with 58% saying it is the sameand decreased for 27% families. The non-essential consumption net scoreis at -12.Again,North shows a better sentiment on non-essentials with an increase for 22% families.</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif"/>  Health still remains an important consideration, with consumption on health-relateditems has increased or remained same for 78% of familiesand decreased only for 22% families. This decrease is 27% in western India. The health score which has a negative connotation i.e. the lesser the spends on health items the better the sentiments, has a value of -19.</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif"/>  Consumption of media has increased for 28% families, decreased for 25%& remained same for 47%. The net score of media is at +3.Media consumption increase is highestin the 18–25-yearage group which are still not going out to the extent the other age groups are.</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif"/>  In terms of mobility 92% families saying they are going out the same or less on short vacations / mall / restaurants, with the overall mobility score at -24</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a"><b>The overall Consumer Sentiment Scoreis moving in the positive direction with a score of +0.5 over the previous month.The overall consumer sentiment score is calculated by % Increase -% Decrease and is expressed as a number from -100 to 100; the score is negative when the sentiments show more decreaseas compared to increase, and positive in the opposite situation.</b></p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Apart from the capturing sentiments which is the measure of overall consumer confidence, the study also captured some interesting trends on topical matters:
         <ul style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px; color:#4a4a4a; text-align:justify;list-style-position: inside">
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif"/>  59% people said either offices should be opened or there should be a hybrid model of working which should be applied in terms of work.</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif"/>  Interestingly 80% of families said schools should be open, which shows that parents are increasingly concerned about overall child development which has happened in the last one year. Surprisingly, in comparison to national average only 56% parents in South want the schools to open. Almost 100% of the younger age group want the schools to open.</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif"/>  74% mentioned that availability of Covid vaccines is now easier.</li>
            <li><img src="images/arrow.gif"/>  With special focus to the rural households, 81% of the individuals were confident of a good kharif season on the back of a normal monsoon this year.</li>
         </ul>

            released its findings of the India Consumer Sentiment Index, a monthly analysis of consumer
            perception on a wide range of issues, for the month of August. 
         </p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px; color:#4a4a4a; text-align:justify">The net CSI score, calculated by subtracting the percentage increase from the percentage
            decrease in sentiment, was recorded at +6,rising at the fastest pace over the last month,
            indicative of a positive shift in consumer consumption metrics.
         </p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px; color:#4a4a4a; text-align:justify">The sentiment analysis delves into 5 relevant sub-indices – Overall household spending, spending
            on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits & mobility trends.
         </p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px; color:#4a4a4a;text-align:justify"><b>The surveys was carried out via Computer Aided Telephonic Interviews with a sample size of
            10482 people. 72% of the people surveyed were male and 28% female. The respondents were
            from 28 states and 7 Union Territories.</b>
         </p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px; color:#4a4a4a; text-align:justify">Commenting on the August report, Pradeep Gupta, CMD, Axis My India, said, <i>“As the festive
            season approaches, consumers are slowly stepping out–as proven by increased numbers for nonessential spending and mobility. This should have a positive effect on the hospitality industry
            which has been severely affected due to the pandemic. Tourism, however, continues to be a
            concern as 83% of the respondents are still averse to travelling. Economic sentiment is looking
            buoyant with ~64% of the respondents expecting the Sensex to cross 60,000 before the end of this
            year. Along with the nation-wide vaccination drive, over 96% respondents pledging to adhere to
            all covid protocols, it is hoped that there will not be a surge in cases post the festive season. A net
            positive score of an additional 5.5 points over the last month indicates a steady progress towards
            social and economic normalcy, with this trend expected to improve further in the next few months.
            Overall, we hold a cautious but optimistic outlook on consumer sentiments. By plugging into
            economically and culturally significant data-points, the CSI will try to gauge, interpret, and predict
            the impact of macro factors on the lives of the average India across demography & geographies.
            Our mission is to bring out the most authentic voices via the rigour of data and analytics”</i>

               items has increased or remained same for 79% of families and decreased only for 21%
               families. The health score which has a negative connotation i.e. the lesser the spends on

               happened last year might not be the same this year. This expected increase in spends is

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a"><b>Axis My India, a leading consumer data intelligence company, released its findings of the <b>India Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI)</b>, a monthly analysis of consumer perception on a wide range of issues, for the month of September.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The net CSI score, calculated by percentage increase minus percentage decrease in sentiment, was recorded at +7, rising at a constant pace over the last three months, indicative of a positive shift in consumer consumption metrics.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The sentiment analysis delves into 5 relevant sub-indices – Overall household spending, spending on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits & mobility trends.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">This month, Axis My India’s Consumer Sentiment Index also delved deeper to understand perception around festival spends, pre and post Covid behavioural changes in terms of online purchase and UPI/wallet payment and citizen’s interest in IPL.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a"><b>The surveys were carried out via Computer Aided Telephonic Interviews with a sample size of 10639 people. 59% belonged from Rural India while 41% belonged from urban counterparts covering 28 states and 8 union territories.</b></p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Commenting on the September report, Pradeep Gupta, CMD, Axis My India, said,<i> “As the pandemic retreats, we are seeing a steady return to normalcy, but with a cautious control over spending considerations. This is highlighted in the survey as 46% of the respondents will prefer spending on small ticket items such as clothes, while only 11% of the respondents will consider buying a two-wheeler or car. Expenditure on household essentials is more or less same since the last two months. However, expenditure on healthcare decreased compared to last month, suggesting people are being decreasingly affected by the pandemic. While 27% respondents reported an increase in UPI transactions, almost 49% still don’t use UPI/Wallets, suggesting a tremendous opportunity in digital payments. IPL has proved its unparalleled reach and what is emerging as a trend is that audiences are increasingly viewing it on digital especially in tier 3/rural markets which still have electricity cuts & are single TV households."</i></p>

While Diwali has triggered spending on products of personal indulgence (like 2-wheeler/4-wheelers or jewellery) and household items, the upcoming festivities and enthusiastic consumer sentiment will further set the momentum for the last half of this year. In addition, one can also witness a transition in terms of preferences amongst consumers’ like opting for EVs or cheering for privatisation of loss making companies. The growth of digital as a medium of advertising overtaking Print & just after TV reflects the change in media consumption habits which was triggered by the pandemic. Lastly our survey shows that a vast majority of India is still not investing in this age of cryptocurrencies, it would be interesting to see how financial players beyond traditional banks can capture and convert their interests for investments using varied instruments."</i></p>

The month of November reveals same media consumption for the majority of the families as last month. Consumer’s online behaviour further reflect a preference of Indian languages over others.</p>

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The sentiment analysis delves into 5 relevant sub-indices – Overall household spending, spending on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits & mobility trends.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">This month, Axis My India’s Sentiment Index also delved deeper to understand consumer’s consumption in the digital ecosystem in terms of OTT platforms, language preferences. Consumer sentiment was also tracked to understand their expenses in terms of discretionary products and investment preferences. In addition, the survey tracked consumer’s opinion on India’s performance in the T20 Word Cup.</p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a"><b>The surveys were carried out via Computer Aided Telephonic Interviews with a sample size of 10552 people across 36 states. 64% belonged from Rural India while 36% belonged from urban counterparts.</b></p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Commenting on the November report, Pradeep Gupta, CMD, Axis My India, said,<i>"With the year approaching to an end, we witness consumer’s gradual return to normalcy though a slight drop in Net Promoter Score also demonstrates that the impact of festive spending is slowly tapering. While media consumptions remain standard for majority, our CSI Survey has further revealed that consumers from the north as well as the south favour vernacular languages when engaging with the digital mediums. This insight opens up opportunities for various local as well as national and international players in terms of where & which form to place their brand content and advertisements.  Moreover it is interesting to note that inspite of a plethora of new age tech firms coming up with IPOs, Indian consumers still prefer to park their confidence in established companies and Government owned stocks and shares, providing a contrarian approach to the FOMO investing theory"</i></p>

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Axis My India, a leading consumer data intelligence company, released its latest findings of the <b> India Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) </b>, a monthly analysis of consumer perception on a wide range of issues. The month of December reveals a slight dip in increased consumption or surge in steady consumption across the 5 relevant sub-indices.

         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">The sentiment analysis delves into 5 relevant sub-indices – Overall household spending, spending on essential and non-essential items, spending on healthcare, media consumption habits & mobility trends. </p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">This month, Axis My India’s Sentiment Index also probed deeper to understand consumer’s sentiment with regards to the new Omicron variant, its impact on economy and requirement of a booster dose. The survey further tracked consumer preferences in terms of news consumption and frequently used digital applications. Finally, the January survey also revealed consumers views on the most impactful celebrity/personality of 2021 and their thoughts in 2022.  </p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a"><b>The surveys were carried out via Computer Aided Telephonic Interviews with a sample size of 10563 people across 36 states. 71% belonged from Rural India while 29% belonged from urban counterparts. In addition, 64% of the respondents were male while 36% of the respondents were female.</b></p>
         <p style="line-height:24px;letter-spacing:0px;color:#4a4a4a">Commenting on the December report, Pradeep Gupta, CMD, Axis My India, said,<i> “The survey finds that PM Modi is by far the most impactful person of 2021 as voted by 40% of the people across India. While the new year brought along hope and optimism for a better 2022, consumers purse strings suggest otherwise. The lowest dip in non-essential spending is a proof that consumers are curling back to apprehensions triggered by the new variant of the virus and hoping for a booster dose, something which has recently been announced by the Government.Moreover, the higher preference of web for seeking news only reflect the gradual change in media consumption behaviour owing to consistent lockdown experienced by consumers in the last two years. In addition, the inclination towards WhatsApp, Facebook and YouTube reflects an evolved and unconscious mode of conversing, converging or consuming dialogue/information/media."</i></p>
